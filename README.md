An audio workstation in progress built in Zig

## Why

I have always wanted to learn audio programming but never knew how. Found Zig a year ago and fell in ❤ 😍 💖  with it. Took a dive and decided to start this

## Design

Currently no design yet, at least with the Gui since it is waiting to play around with ZGT repo.

First lower level stuff
